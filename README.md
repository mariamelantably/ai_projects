# AI PROJECTS
This repository consists of various AI projects, ranging in complexity and the type of algorithm used. Many of these were developed during my time interning at VAIS AI. 
The algorithms used include Classification, Linear & Polynomial Regression, MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, LLMs and more. 

## Included Projects
- RAG: A code which builds two versions of a RAG algorithms using ollama models. The first is a simple RAG based on cosine similarity and the second is a hybrid RAG using FAISS and BM25
- Gemini API: A code testing and playing around with the various uses of Gemini API, from text to vision to embeddings.
- Mathematics of a NN: Consists of a code which shows how to run through a simple neural network by hand and a paper which runs through the neural network and goes through the mathematics.
- Sentiment Analysis: A code which uses Vanilla RNNs and LSTMs to predict positive or negative sentiments in the IMDB datatset.
- Tokenizer: A basic tokenizer built resembling that of ChatGPT.
- Traffic Sign Classification: A code that classifies a set of traffic labels into 58 classes using a convolutional neural network
- Wine Quality Evaluation: A code that evaluates wine quality using both classification and MLPs and attempts to predict density using regression and an MLP Regressor algorithm.
